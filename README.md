# CHALLENGE BNP ANTLIA

## Description:

Use the template below, respecting the cardinality, the primary and foreign keys, and also the data type. The tables "
Product" and "PRODUCT_COSIF" can be considered as domain data, and therefore some records can be manually inserted in
order to facilitate the movement insertion tests.
NOTE: As I have a superficial knowledge of the Oracle database I adapted the data for the PostgreSQL database.
